LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that:\n","- Freezes the pre-trained model weights\n","- Adds small trainable rank decomposition matrices to attention layers\n","- Typically reduces trainable parameters by ~90%\n","- Maintains model performance while being memory efficient\n","\n","We'll cover:\n","1. Setup development environment and LoRA configuration\n","2. Create and prepare the dataset for adapter training\n","3. Fine-tune using `trl` and `SFTTrainer` with LoRA adapters\n","4. Test the model and merge adapters (optional)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fXqd9BXgouLi"},"source":["## 1. Setup development environment\n","\n","Our first step is to install Hugging Face Libraries and Pyroch, including trl, transformers and datasets. If you haven't heard of trl yet, don't worry.
